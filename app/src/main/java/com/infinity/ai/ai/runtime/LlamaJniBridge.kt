/**
 * LlamaJniBridge
 *
 * This Kotlin object declares the native (C++) functions we wrote in infinity_jni.cpp.
 *
 * HOW THIS WORKS:
 * - "external fun" tells Kotlin: "this function is implemented in C++, not Kotlin"
 * - When called, Android's JNI system routes the call to our .so library
 * - The C++ function name must match: Java_com_infinity_ai_ai_runtime_LlamaJniBridge_<methodName>
 *
 * The companion object's init block loads our compiled .so file.
 * "infinity_jni" matches the library name in CMakeLists.txt: add_library(infinity_jni ...)
